# Gum Theme

hello! this is my first time customizing a neovim theme. It's ripped from the wonderful [thorn](https://github.com/jpwol/thorn.nvim) theme because it's nicely organized and made sense to my brain, so shoutout to jpwol. this is under very active development as I continuously tweak it to suite me.
